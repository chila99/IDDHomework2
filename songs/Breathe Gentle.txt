Tiziano Ferro
Breathe Gentle Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I want to give you all of me, the underneath
Want you to show me imperfection is actually love
I thought, cursed, I was cursed, destined to be lonely
A circle in a world of squares, where nobody knows me
So with every footstep, I must follow
The kissing moments, I thought were impossible
Breathe gentle, Be gentle
Don't leave me behind
'Cause love goes fast, oh, oh
Gentle (Gentle), be gentle (Gentle)
Never let me go when love goes faster
I will be gentle

See, photographs have only two dimensions
But love defies all logic in a picture
Above all that is physical, I'm falling
Falling uncontrollably, it terrifies me, so
So if my compass, it fails me
And I feel I'm walking blind, don't say goodbye
(Don't let me hide)
Oh, please don't let me spiral
Tortured by you, oh, sweet torture!
I am a pirate, love my fortune
The walls have fallen now
The key is yours to turn, I'm breathing

Breathe gentle, Be gentle
Don't leave me behind
'Cause love goes fast, oh, oh
Gentle (Gentle), be gentle (Gentle)
Never let me go when love goes faster
I will be gentle
You might also like
Every time I run somehow love is faster
Without you, loneliness is everlasting
I still feel you
But I hear you, loudly
Screaming, "Please wait for me"
'Cause I don't want to hurt you
And I don't want to lose this love this time

Se cerco lo vedo
L'amore va veloce e tu stai indietro
Se cerchi mi vedi
Il bene pi segreto sfugge all'uomo che non guarda avanti, mai
Eh, eh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh, Ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, Ooh-ooh, oh
Ooh-ooh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
