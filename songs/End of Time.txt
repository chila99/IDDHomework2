End of Time Lyrics

Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby, I'll promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go
Take you away from here
There's nothing between us but space and time
I'll be your own little star
Let me shine in your world
In your own little universe, make me your girl

Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby, I'll promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go

Baby, come on, get up on it
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you, baby, let's go (Whoa)
Let's go (Whoa)
I wanna provide this loving that you're giving
I ain't frontin' in this love, but
Can you let me love you from your head to toe? (Whoa)
Baby, let's go (Whoa)
You might also like
Boy, come to me (Come to me)
Let me turn your rain into sun (Come to me, baby)
You don't have to worry, baby (Oh, no)
I promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul
You go, I go, we go, that's all she wrote

Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
(Can't you see, babe?)
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
(I just wanna love you)
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
(Can't you feel me, babe?)
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna live with you
I'll never let you go
Free your love to me
Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night (Kiss you at night)
I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby, I'll promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go18Embed
