Signs Lyrics
In December, every sign has its own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine?

I was in love with a Sagittarius, he blew my mind
He also had a flip side too much like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus, the way he handled me, yeah
Flirtatious like an Aries
Which sign is best for me?
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all

Hey, I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
(Rewind)
I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
I want him sexy like a Scorpio
The way he holds me close, yeah
Sensitive as a Cancer
Every sign from coast to coast

Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
You might also like
I can't explain why I love him
Bossy like Leo's do
Got game like an Aquarius
Switch moves after he been with you
Fun like a Libra
He stays on my mind
He's so unpredictable
He reminds me of every sign

Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius
I love all y'all

Every sign from the first to the last (Ohh)
Everyday of the month has its good and its bad
(Everyday of the month)
I love you all, all twelve signs
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
(Suirauqa na ekil emag tog)
Every one of these signs, you know you blowing me away
(Suirauqa na ekil emag tog)
No matter when you're born for sure with me, you're okay
(Suirauqa na ekil emag tog)
I love every one of y'all no matter what sign you are
(Suirauqa na ekil emag tog)
January to December, here's my open arms
