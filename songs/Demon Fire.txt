Demon Fire Lyrics
He loves to drive 'em crazy
With his evil lips
Great guns are blazin'
On a deathly trip

Yeah, born of no family, born of no creed
Yeah, raised by a jackal, raised a bad seed
You better look around before you hit the ground
Give me no quarrel
Lives of crime
Like a devil on a deadline
Gonna send you down

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire

Seeking out power, girl, I'll hunt you down
Boy, Lord of the Flies is gonna knock you out
You better look around
Hear the evil sound
Give me no quarrel, drenched in grime

With all the bad intentions
Gonna send you down

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire
Demon fire, flames burn higher
Demon fire, it's an all-out hellfire

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire
Demon fire, flames burn higher
Demon fire, it's an all-out hellfire
Fire, demon, fire
Fire, demon, fire
