Each Tear Lyrics
Woohoohoo, whooohooohoo
Whoohoo, whoohohohohoo

Theres something that I want to say
But I feel like don't know how
Still I just can't hold it one more day
So I think I let it out
You're on my mind more than I may sure
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want
Is to you to fall apart
Your future will be clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
Theres a lesson, (theres a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
And each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can't take away what you're meant to be

We can't change the things
That we done that's in the past
But fighting won't get us anyway
So if you want, heres my hand
Every night there is one thing I do
I bow my head and I pray for you (pray for you)

You might also like

You're much more than a struggle that you go trough
From nine till five I open things so let it go
You're not a victim
You're more like a winner
And you're not defeat
You're more like a queen


Dentro il male del dolore che ti ho detto
Più della mancanza forte che ti ho detto
Più di tutti quanti i drammi che ti ho detto
Io ti amo e che ti amo ora lo detto
(Each tear)
Queste lacrime figlie di un arma atroce (arma atroce)
Queste lacrime si mostrano alla luce
Queste ore ormai umide di lacrime
Cancellano il timore e me che intemplano la lapide
(già, già già, già)
No no we can't be held out
No no, no no
I I I can't be held out
You you you can't be held out
We we we can't be held out
Love
It makes you so much stronger (stronger)
It makes you so much wiser
In each tear
And you're so close to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can't take away you're meant to beEmbed
