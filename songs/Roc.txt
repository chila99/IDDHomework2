Roc Lyrics
Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I

If I wrote a book about were we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life With Superman."
That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday in all the things you do
In all the things you say
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh Oh Oh I

If I were to try to count the ways to make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before i run out of timeless
Things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my loving strong
Make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
And what you need
Give you my whole heart
Not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish  I'm talking every dream
You might also like
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you

If there's options, i don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you. I like us
Just fine. You're a rock in a sand, you're a smile in a
Cry, you're my joy through the pain, you're the truth
Through the lies. No matter what i do, i know that i can
Count on you
Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I

You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you10Embed
