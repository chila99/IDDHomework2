Hello Lyrics
I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining, lightin' up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say, and
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
Baby, when you (When you)
Stole my cool (Stole my cool)
'Cause you had me at hello (My cool, hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello, hello)

I get so excited when you travel with me
Baby, while I'm on my grind
And never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time and
You keep me humble out of this hype
'Cause you know there's more to life
And if I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know
You might also like
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
Baby, when you (When you)
Stole my cool (Stole my cool)
You had me at hello (My cool, hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello, hello)

Gotta feel you
And be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you
Wanna show you
That without you, my sun doesn't shine
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you
Boy, without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you

You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
When you (When you)
Stole my cool (Stole my cool)
You had me at hello (My cool, hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello, hello)
It was many years ago
Baby, when you
Stole my cool
You had me at hello
Hello
