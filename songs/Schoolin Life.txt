Schoolin’ Life Lyrics
This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a mother****
This is for them 50-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

Mom and Dad tried to hide the world
Said, the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made 'em want me more
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink"
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy, I'm out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)

This is for them pretty somethings
Livin' in the fast lane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them chipper somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy, I'm out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)

You know it costs to be the boss
One day, you'll run the town
For now, make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucker down

I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy, I'm out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

There's not a real way to live this, for real
Just remember to stay relentless
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished
Yeah, yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Hey, hey, hey12Embed
