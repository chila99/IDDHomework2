Imagine Dragons
Believer (Remix) Lyrics
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been-oh, ooh
The way that things have been-oh, ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea-oh, ooh
The master of my sea-oh, ooh
I was broken from a young age
Takin' my sulkin' to the masses
Writin' my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
Singin' from heartache from the pain
Takin' my message from the veins
Speakin' my lesson from the brain
Seein' the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

First things first, can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you, Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without…
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without…

Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins-oh, ooh
The blood in my veins-oh, ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer7Embed
