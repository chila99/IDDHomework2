FIND YOUR WAY BACK Lyrics
Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say, "Follow me"
Daddy used to lead me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside

He said, "Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back"
Daddy used to tell me, "Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it"

"But you just gotta find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back"

Daddy used to teach me all my moves
Runnin' 'round wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, have to run my race
You might also like
"Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back, yeah"

Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, told me run my race
