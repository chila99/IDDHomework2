Ring the Alarm Lyrics
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know (I know)
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke? Oh

You can't stay, you gotta go, oh
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
You might also like
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold, oh
But she gon' love that ****, I know
I done put in a call
Partner, ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, babe?
Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Pent in the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go13Embed
