Imagine Dragons
Blank Space/Stand By Me (Live From Spotify London) Lyrics
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Eh, eh

New money, suit and tie
I could read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
Dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make a bad guy good for a weekend
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
You might also like
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she? "
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darlin', I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby...
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

*Clapping and cheering*
