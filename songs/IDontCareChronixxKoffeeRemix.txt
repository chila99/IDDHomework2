I Donâ€™t Care (Chronixx & Koffee Remix) Lyrics
Ehh
Uhuh huh

Tell the selector say fi turn up the sound
I say the reggae music haffi play, yeah
Dipped in her bag and the she pulled out the pounds
My baby ever got the high grade
Spliff in her mouth, age up the chalice and say, "Shall we blaze?"
Oh yeah!
Out of many, she alone get the crown
Chronixx run Spanish Town
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone got so much things to say
Right now me just a gwan hold a vibes and watch nobody
'Cause I'm only here to spend the night with you, anyway

I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad vibes disappear
She kick off the high heels
No, she nah pree nobody
Happy times and I got no sad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And I&I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere, baby
She touch me softly, then me start squeeze her body
Everything irie, only nice times
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Bad night 'cause a never me and you start it
Well, me ago pull up pon you shortly
Evidently, me miss you badly
'Cause presently me see you hardly
Stand up by mi body and guard me, ohh, yeah
Always, me glad say you choose me
You know say you fit me like shoes
And you make mi life come in like movie
Me no waan see your face screwed up, fi true
So make we forget this party
I'd rather be boo'd up with you, glued up to you
I got overdue love for you, plus new stuff to do
I love you like Keyshia Ka'oir love Guwop
So, woo! You know, boy
You might also like
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
She kick off the high heels
No, she nah pree nobody
Happy times and I got no sad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No)

Watch it! Even though the party no my vibes
Still ago turn it up, me deh here with my bride
Still ago burn it up inna passion and style
Highest set of grades a bubble up inna the pipe, well!
Turn it up again, burn it up again
From you hear da tune yah drop, a just money pull up again
'Mount of woman in the place, and me say, look how much of them
Still a you me love, baby, me swear!

'Cause I don't care (Don't care)
When I'm with my baby, yeah (Oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (Disappear)
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody (Maybe I'm somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (With the bad nights)
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near (Me near)
You can take me anywhere (Anywhere, anywhere)
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody (I'm loved by somebody, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can deal with the bad nights

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh2Embed
