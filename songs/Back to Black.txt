Back to Black Lyrics
I, I, I left no time to regret
Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh, and you, you and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back to
You go back to

I, I love you much
It's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to blackYou might also like17Embed
